# HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

## üìù Introduction 
In the business world, keeping talented employees is a big challenge. One major issue is the growing problem of employee turnover, often called HR attrition. High turnover can seriously affect a company's productivity and stability. It can lead to higher hiring and training costs, disrupt teamwork, and cause the loss of valuable knowledge within the company. That's why it's so important to understand what drives attrition and to put effective retention strategies in place to stay competitive and ensure long-term success.

## üí° Objective
- Check the Current Turnover Rates: Start by getting a clear picture of the current employee turnover rate. Break it down by factors like age, gender, education level, department, and job role to spot any patterns.

- Find the Main Reasons for Turnover: Look into the key reasons employees leave. This includes job satisfaction aspects like involvement and work-life balance, salary-related factors such as monthly pay and raises, and benefits like stock options. Analyzing these factors can help uncover trends that lead to higher turnover.
