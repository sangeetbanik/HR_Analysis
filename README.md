# HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

In the business world, keeping talented employees is a big challenge. One major issue is the growing problem of employee turnover, often called HR attrition. High turnover can seriously affect a company's productivity and stability.

That's why it's so important to understand what drives attrition and to put effective retention strategies in place to stay competitive and ensure long-term success.
